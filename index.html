    <p>Hello! I usually go by Mewfuzz or some nickname on the Internet. Many things capture my intrest and this site features some of them.</p>
    <p>Reach out: <a href="mailto:pranavgn2005@gmail.com">pranavgn2005@gmail.com </a> or discord @mewfuzz</a></p>
    <p>Find me: <a href="https://github.com/pranavgn12">[Github]</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pranav-g-n-ba8a94296/"> [Linkdin]</a></p>
    <h2>Computers!</h2>
    <p>I spend most of my time online and working with computers, learning about programming languages, AI infrastructure, GPUs, processor and semiconductor innovations, and low-level computing. I also tinker with Linux by watching YouTube tutorials. In my free time, I make games, design, and watch anime.</p>
    <h2>Animes!</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy anime, from intriguing series like Heavenly Delusion—a post-apocalyptic story following characters navigating a devastated world while exploring themes of identity, survival, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion—to comedies like Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. I occasionally draw some of these characters and often find creative inspiration from these shows.

        Music!
    </h2>
    <p>
    I love japanese music that is sometimes ending/ opening of some animes. They are creative and enjoyable</p>
    <p>

    <h2>Other things!</h2>
    <P>For the first time in my life, I've started liking physical activity. I am a fan of origami. I love English movies like knives out, shutter island. </P>
    <p>Bye!</p>
