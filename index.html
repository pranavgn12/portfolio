    <h2>Computers!</h2>
    <p>I spend most of my time online and working with computers, learning about programming languages, AI infrastructure, GPUs, processor and semiconductor innovations, and low-level computing. I also tinker with Linux by watching YouTube tutorials. In my free time, I make games, design, and watch anime.</p>
    <h2>Animes!</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy anime, from intriguing series like Heavenly Delusion—a post-apocalyptic story following characters navigating a devastated world while exploring themes of identity, survival, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion—to comedies like Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. I occasionally draw some of these characters and often find creative inspiration from these shows.

    <h2>
        Music!
    </h2>
    <p>
    I love japanese music that is sometimes ending/ opening of some animes. They are creative and enjoyable</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h2>Other things!</h2>
    <P>For the first time in my life, I've started liking physical activity. I am a fan of origami. I love English movies like knives out, shutter island. </P>
    <p>Bye!</p>
