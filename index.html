    <h2>Computers!</h2>
    <p>
        I got a computer at home when was in 5th grade. The curiousity unfolded about how it worked, usage and games. I spent my time daily intracting with computer. Luckily 
        i got exposed to Linux through ubuntu. The schools were using a customized distro of ubuntu "Edubuntu" tailered for education needs with most popular opensource programs. It was fun to play with it. I learned about some linux stuff too.
        <br/><br/>
        Dad got me introduced to <a href ="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">SCRATCH</a>. I learned to program by making many games and projects,<a href ="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/pranavhaha/projects/" target="_blank">[Checkout my projects]</a>. I have designed games, game assests , thunmbnails etc. 
        Scratch is cool with many creators making amazing projects. I took inspiration from them and created or implemented from them. Some of my games are popular.
        I have interacted with scartch community, talked with many folks and it was fun to collaborate with them.
        <br/><br/>
        Recently i spend most of my time working with computers, learning about programming, AI, AI infrastructure, GPUs, Processor, Scienece, semiconductor innovations, and low-level computing. I also enjoy tinkering with Linux using YouTube tutorials.
    </p>
    <h2>Animes!</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy anime, from intriguing series like Heavenly Delusion—a post-apocalyptic story following characters navigating a devastated world while exploring themes of identity, survival, and the blurred lines between reality and illusion—to comedies like Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. I occasionally draw some of these characters and often find creative inspiration from these shows.
    <h3>Ghibli!</h3>
    <p>I really love ghibli movies. Ghibli movies portray good human values. They are much closer to real life. There is <span id="magic">magic</span> in ghbili movies. Ghibli movies have amazing level of details. The the deliberate use of negative space, pauses, and intervals creates a sense of balance, harmony, and meaning  in ghibli movies. Ghibli movies are charming and relaxing to watch. My favourite ghilbi movies are <span id="favGh">Spirited Away, The wind Rises, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, My Neighbor Totoro etc.</span> </p>
